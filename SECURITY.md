# Security Policy for Playloom Interactive and Playloom Engine

At **Playloom Interactive**, we are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of **Playloom Engine** and the data of our users. This security policy outlines the measures we take to protect the engine, its users, and the overall ecosystem. It also describes the responsibilities of our users and contributors to help ensure that Playloom Engine remains secure and trusted.

## 1. Security of Playloom Engine

We implement several layers of security to protect Playloom Engine and its components:

### 1.1. **Source Code Security**
   - The source code of Playloom Engine is publicly available on GitHub. We regularly review and audit our codebase to ensure that no security vulnerabilities or backdoors exist.
   - All pull requests are carefully reviewed by our maintainers before being merged to ensure no malicious or unsafe code is introduced into the engine.
   - Contributors must adhere to best practices for secure coding, including input validation, error handling, and encryption when necessary.

### 1.2. **Data Security**
   - Playloom Engine does not collect or store any user data by default. Any user data collected through the engine (for example, for online services or multiplayer games) is stored securely and handled according to best data protection practices.
   - All sensitive user data, such as passwords, is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. We never store unencrypted passwords or sensitive data.
   - We do not share user data with third parties without explicit consent, except as required by law.

### 1.3. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Playloom Engine may integrate with third-party services (e.g., cloud storage, multiplayer servers). We review these services for security and only partner with trusted providers that meet our security standards.
   - We regularly audit these third-party services to ensure they continue to meet our security requirements.

   - Always validate user input and sanitize outputs.
   - Ensure proper access control and authentication mechanisms in code that involves user data or external services.

### 2.3. **Access Control**
   - Users should not share their credentials (e.g., API keys, access tokens) with unauthorized parties. Use unique credentials for each service you connect with Playloom Engine.
   - Contributors with access to the Playloom Engine codebase or repositories should be aware of the importance of safeguarding access credentials and should follow the principle of least privilege.

### 4.3. **Notification**
   - Affected users and contributors will be notified of the security incident, the steps taken to mitigate it, and any required actions on their part (e.g., changing passwords, updating the engine).
   - We will also release a public security advisory detailing the incident and how it was addressed.
